# Sample Focus Buddy Session

## User Input
```
I have so much to do and only 25 minutes before my next meeting:
- Review 3 pull requests
- Write API documentation for /users endpoint
- Reply to Sarah about Q4 planning
- Fix authentication bug that's blocking QA
- Prep slides for Friday demo (need 10 slides)

I'm pretty tired right now.
```

## Focus Buddy Response

**Summary:** We'll fix the auth bug and review one quick PR—both unblock your team and are manageable when tired.

**Timeline:**
- 0-3 min: Skim all 3 PRs and pick the smallest/simplest one
- 3-18 min: Deep focus on authentication bug (find root cause + implement fix)
- 18-23 min: Review and approve the simple PR
- 23-25 min: Write quick handoff note on bug status

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify simplest PR to review
- [ ] Fix or fully document the auth bug
- [ ] Complete one PR review with feedback
- [ ] Leave note on bug progress for team

**Check-in:** Come back in 25 minutes and let me know what you got done!

## 25 Minutes Later...

**User:** "I fixed the auth bug and reviewed one PR. Didn't get to the handoff note."

**Focus Buddy:** 

Great work! You completed the two most important items—the bug was blocking QA and the PR review unblocks a teammate.

**For next time:**
- The handoff note takes 2 minutes; let's schedule that at the start of your next block
- Consider doing PR reviews in batches (all 3 at once) rather than one-off

**Remaining tasks:**
- 2 more PR reviews
- API docs for /users
- Sarah's email reply
- Demo slides
